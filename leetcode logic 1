The provided code is a solution to a problem where you are given:

An integer n, representing the size of an array of numbers from 1 to n.

A list of conflictingPairs, where each pair [a, b] indicates that both a and b cannot be in the same subarray.

üß© Understanding the Problem:
You must compute the maximum number of non-conflicting subarrays that can be formed from the array of size n.

üîç Leetcode Pattern Followed:
The code falls under the Greedy + Sorting + Interval Scheduling pattern, commonly seen in problems such as:

Interval Partitioning / Interval Scheduling

Activity Selection Problem

Weighted Interval Scheduling (Profit-based intervals)

Greedy Algorithms for Conflict Resolution

üìö Common Leetcode Patterns Matched:
Pattern Type	Explanation
Greedy Algorithm	Tries to maximize profit by choosing optimal intervals.
Interval Scheduling	Sorts the conflicting pairs by their endpoints, like classic interval problems.
Dynamic Sliding Bound	Keeps track of max1 and max2 to adjust profit dynamically.
Prefix Optimization	Accumulates the optimal "profit" across sorted intervals.
