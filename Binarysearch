tep 1: Start With a Real-Life Example (Very Important)
Ask your student:
             “If I tell you to find page 350 in a 1000-page book, will you start from page 1?”
They’ll say No.
Then say:
             👉 “You open the book in the middle first!”

That’s Binary Search thinking.
🎯 Step 2: Explain the Basic Idea
Binary Search means:
🔥 Divide the search space into HALF every time.

public class Main {
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {

        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {

            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] == target)
                return mid;

            else if (target > arr[mid])
                low = mid + 1;

            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }

        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[] arr = {2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72};

        System.out.println(binarySearch(arr, 23));
    }
}
