This code solves the **LeetCode problem "Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets"** using **recursive backtracking** (brute force). Here's a breakdown of the logic like a **"daily Leetcoder"** would think about it:

---

### ✅ **Problem Understanding**

Given an array `nums`, we need to count how many **subsets** of `nums` have the **maximum possible bitwise OR** value.

* Subsets can be of any length (including single elements).
* Bitwise OR (`|`) means combining bits; the result has a bit set if any of the inputs have it set.

---

### 🔍 **Step-by-step Logic**

1. **Find the Maximum Possible OR (maxOr)**

   * Go through each element of `nums`, do bitwise OR of all.
   * This gives the **highest OR value** any subset can reach (maybe using all elements).

   ```cpp
   for(int &num : nums) {
       maxOr |= num;
   }
   ```

2. **Recursively Explore All Subsets**

   * At each index, decide to either:

     * **Include** the current number (`currOr | nums[idx]`)
     * **Exclude** the current number (`currOr`)
   * Recursively continue for the rest of the elements.

3. **Base Case**

   * If `idx == nums.size()` (we've looked at all elements), check if `currOr == maxOr`.

     * If yes, count this subset.
     * Otherwise, ignore it.

   ```cpp
   if(idx == nums.size()) {
       if(currOr == maxOr)
           return 1;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

### 🧠 **Core Idea**

> Try **all possible subsets** and **count** how many of them give `maxOr` as the result.

Time complexity:

* **O(2^n)**: Each element has 2 choices → include or exclude → total `2^n` subsets.

---

### 🏁 Example

Input: `nums = [3, 1]`

* `maxOr = 3` (`3 | 1 = 3`)
* All subsets:

  * `[] → 0` ❌
  * `[3] → 3` ✅
  * `[1] → 1` ❌
  * `[3,1] → 3` ✅
    Answer: `2` subsets give max OR.

---

### 🔁 TL;DR Logic

1. Get the `maxOr` by OR-ing all elements.
2. Use recursion to try **all subsets**.
3. Count the ones where OR result equals `maxOr`.
